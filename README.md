# Unravelling-Temporal-patterns   

The program has the capability to real time categorize time series data into various classes such as periodic, chaotic, noise, hyperchaotic, etc. This classification is performed in real-time using an Arduino Microcontroller. Additionally, the program offers a visualization feature similar to an oscilloscope. It can take input data, such as temperature readings from any system, and directly forecast its behavior.

If the trained model also can distnguish period doubling etc then it should also be able to predict those as well.

To utilize the program, you simply need to convert input voltages to a range of 0-5 volts and input them into the A0 pin of an Arduino, which can then be connected to a laptop. The user interface will prompt the user to select a pre-trained model, and subsequently, the predicted class will be displayed in the user interface.
